    Beginning in Rails 4, Rails ships with a `rails` binstub at ./bin/rails that
    should be used instead of the Bundler-generated `rails` binstub.
    
    If you are seeing this message, your binstub at ./bin/rails was generated by
    Bundler instead of Rails.
    
    You might need to regenerate your `rails` binstub locally and add it to source
    control:
    
     rails app:update:bin           # Bear in mind this generates other binstubs
                                    # too that you may or may not want (like yarn)
    
    If you already have Rails binstubs in source control, you might be
    inadvertently overwriting them during deployment by using bundle install
    with the --binstubs option.
    
    If your application was created prior to Rails 4, here's how to upgrade:
    
      bundle config --delete bin    # Turn off Bundler's stub generator
      rails app:update:bin          # Use the new Rails executables
      git add bin                   # Add bin/ to source control
    
    You may need to remove bin/ from your .gitignore as well.
    
    When you install a gem whose executable you want to use in your app,
    generate it and add it to source control:
    
      bundle binstubs some-gem-name
      git add bin/new-executable
